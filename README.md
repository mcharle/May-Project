This is an independent project I did in May of 2013 while I was shadowing Kunal Bhat at gravitytank.<br>
<h4>What is May Project?</h4>
May Project is an opportunity for seniors at the high school attended to do an independent project, rather than attend classes,
for the last month of their senior year. My project was creating a blog.<br>
The Blog
===========
Each dated post consists of <b>text</b>, which describes what I did that day and a <b>picture</b> that goes with the description.
